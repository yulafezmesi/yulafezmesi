### Hi there, Mert here ðŸ‘‹

I work as a frontend developer having comprehensive knowledge on Javascript. Iâ€™m capable of combining single concept technologies with modern elements including React, Vue, Node.js, Gatsby, Next.js, CSS. I thrive while working with an open and collaborative team as we work together to solve complex issues and create amazing, dynamic products by building reusable, efficient components. In the process of gaining experience and contributing to related areas of expertise, I integrated modern applications through my sharp sense of technical programming knowledge.
